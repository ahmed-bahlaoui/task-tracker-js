## Roadmap.sh challenge submission

### Simple task tracker using Javascript

## Challenge requirements:

You are required to create a task tracker that lets users add new tasks, mark them as complete, or delete them. Completed tasks will be moved to the end of the list and will have strikethrough, and users can unmark tasks to return them to the pending list.

Here is the mockup of the task tracker:
